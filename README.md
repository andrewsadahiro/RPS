Rock Paper Scissors vs Bot
This project uses Raspberry Pi 5, ADS1115, two flex sensors, a 16x2 LCD Display, and a Tonal Buzzer.

The purpose of this project is to be able to play Rock Paper Scissors with a bot, and **actually use your own hand** instead of just typing in your input.

Below is a flowchart showing the general steps the code goes through as it runs.
